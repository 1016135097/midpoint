    <documentation>A device has some special characteristics:

        1. It is held by at most single user at given time.

        2. It gives its holder some properties, e.g. the `organizational` obtains value of
        `D users` for any device D held.

        3. On the other hand, it knows who uses it by storing the user's `name` and `fullName` in
        its `description` property.

        Note that points 2 and 3 are implemented by object templates (point 2 by template for users
        and point 3 by template for services). This means that they work for both active and
        inactive devices. For a different approach please see the "token" archetype.

                automatically when device is assigned or unassigned.)

    <inducement>

                Recomputes a device when it is assigned to (or unassigned from) the user or when the assignment
                is modified. But what we would need, actually, is triggering device recompute when the effective membership
                is changed.
