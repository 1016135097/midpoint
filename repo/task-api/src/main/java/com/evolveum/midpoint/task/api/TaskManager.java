/**
 * <p>Task Manager Interface.</p>
 * <p>
 * Status: public
 * Stability: DRAFT
 * @version 0.1
 * @author Radovan Semancik
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Task manager provides controls task execution, coordination, distribution and failover between nodes, etc.
 * </p><p>
 * This interface is just a basic framework for task management now. Although we hope that this is roughly almost final
 * shape of the interface, the implementation is not complete and some changes may happen.  
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This definition specifies interface of Task Manager - a component that controls (asynchronous) task execution.
 * </p><p>
 * The task manager can store the task for later execution, switch them to background
 * resume execution of a task from a different node, etc. Generally speaking, task
 * manager provides operation to manage tasks in the whole midPoint cluster of IDM nodes.
 * </p><p>
 * This interface partially adheres to [Common Interface Concepts], but the goals are slightly
 * different. This interface should be conveniently used also for tasks that are not persistent
 * (synchronous short tasks). Therefore some methods are made much more user-friendly while
 * tolerating some redundancy in the interface.
 * </p>

     * (2) this method returns Tasks, not TaskTypes - a Task provides some information (e.g. getNextRunStartTime())
     *     that is not stored in repository; Task object can be directly used as an input to several methods,
     *     like suspendTask() or releaseTask().

     * @param paging Paging specification
     * @param clusterStatusInformation If null, the method will query cluster nodes to get up-to-date runtime information.
