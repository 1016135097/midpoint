Synchronization reaction "addAccount" does not work (MID-103)

There is a JAXB issue that is causing problems if a content of an QName is
not well qualified, e.g. if it does not have a proper namespace prefix. The
sympotoms are that midPoint seems to think that a part of an object is not
there although it is there. E.g. the problem may appear as following log
message:
Account construction in user template
(OID:c0c010c0-d34d-b33f-f00d-777111111111) must have resource or resourceRef
defined.
The solution is to double-check that all QNames are valid. In this case the
problem was caused by this:
<i:resourceRef oid="c0c010c0-d34d-b33f-f00d-333111111112"
type="ResourceType"/>
which should correctly be defined with an "i" prefix as:
<i:resourceRef oid="c0c010c0-d34d-b33f-f00d-333111111112"
type="i:ResourceType"/>
The problem was reported to the JAXB team (JAXB-833) but it was not yet
resolved.
